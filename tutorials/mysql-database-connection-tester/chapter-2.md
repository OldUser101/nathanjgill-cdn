Add these imports:

```vbnet
Imports MySql.Data
Imports MySql.Data.MySqlClient
```

Add this code to `Form1`:

```vbnet
Dim connectionString As String
Dim mySqlConnection As MySqlConnection
Dim resetDataOnFail As Boolean
Dim readOnlyData As Boolean
Dim passwordChar As String
Dim usePasswordChar As Boolean
Dim resetOnDisconnect As Boolean
```

These are important variables to monitor certain aspects of out program. Also create the last 4 as settings in "*Project/Properties/Settings*" so they can be accessed between forms.

Then add:

```vbnet
Private Sub Form1_Load(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles MyBase.Load
    connect.Enabled = True
    status.Text = "Status: Disconnected"
    UpdateOptions()
End Sub
```

This enables the `connect` button and changes the status. The `UpdateOptions` function is created later.

Add:

```vbnet
Private Sub connect_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles connect.Click
    Try
        connectionString = "server=" & host.Text & ";user=" & user.Text & ";_
        database=" & database.Text & ";password=" & password.Text & ";"
        mySqlConnection = New MySqlConnection(connectionString)
        mySqlConnection.Open()
        status.Text = "Status: Connected"
        connect.Enabled = False
        disconnect.Enabled = True
        If readOnlyData = True Then
            FreezeData()
        End If
    Catch ex As Exception
        status.Text = "Status: Failed"
        connectionString = ""
        mySqlConnection = Nothing
        MsgBox("One or more properties are invalid", MsgBoxStyle.Critical,
               "MySql Connection Tester")
        status.Text = "Status: Disconnected"
        connect.Enabled = True
        disconnect.Enabled = False
        If resetDataOnFail = True Then
            ResetData()
        End If
        Exit Sub
    End Try
End Sub
```

This handles the click event of out `connect` button. The first three lines are to open the connection to the server. The next three lines prepare for out disconnection. `FreezeData` is created later. Underneath, we handle any exceptions that occur. This is most likely when the database cannot be found.

Add:

```vbnet
Private Sub disconnect_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles disconnect.Click
        Try
            mySqlConnection.Close()
            status.Text = "Status: Disconnected"
            connect.Enabled = True
            disconnect.Enabled = False
            connectionString = ""
            mySqlConnection = Nothing
            If resetOnDisconnect = True Then
                MeltAndClearData()
            Else
                MeltData()
            End If
        Catch ex As Exception
            status.Text = "Status: Failed"
            connectionString = ""
            mySqlConnection = Nothing
            MsgBox("One or more properties are invalid", MsgBoxStyle.Critical)
            status.Text = "Status: Connected"
            connect.Enabled = False
            disconnect.Enabled = True
            Exit Sub
        End Try
End Sub
```

Here, we handle the disconnection event, where we disconnect from the database and prepare for re-connection. `MeltAndClearData` and `MeltData` are created later. Underneath, we specify what should happen if we fail to disconnect from the database.

Add:

```vbnet
Public Sub ResetData()
    host.Text = "Host..."
    database.Text = "Database..."
    user.Text = "User..."
    password.Text = "Password..."
End Sub

Public Sub FreezeData()
    host.ReadOnly = True
    database.ReadOnly = True
    user.ReadOnly = True
    password.ReadOnly = True
End Sub

Public Sub MeltData()
    host.ReadOnly = False
    database.ReadOnly = False
    user.ReadOnly = False
    password.ReadOnly = False
End Sub

Public Sub MeltAndClearData()
    MeltData()
    ResetData()
End Sub
```

`ResetData` resets the text in the textboxes. `FreezeData` makes the textboxes read-only so they cannot be modified while we are connected to the database. `MeltData` makes the textboxes editable when we are disconnected. `MeltAndClearData` makes the textboxes editable and it resets them to their defaults.

Add:

```vbnet
Public Sub Button1_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles options.Click
    Form2.ShowDialog()
    If Form2.DialogResult = DialogResult.OK Then
        UpdateOptions()
    End If
End Sub

Public Sub UpdateOptions()
    resetDataOnFail = My.Settings.resetDataOnFail
    readOnlyData = My.Settings.readOnlyDataOnConnected
    usePasswordChar = My.Settings.usePasswordChar
    passwordChar = My.Settings.passwordChar
    resetOnDisconnect = My.Settings.resetOnDisconnected
    If usePasswordChar = True Then
        password.PasswordChar = passwordChar
    Else
        password.PasswordChar = ""
    End If
End Sub
```

Here, we choose what to do when `Button1` is pressed. We also create `UpdateOptions` which reads the data that `Form2` creates and stores them in variables. These are all settings for out application.

Add this code to `Form2`:

```vbnet
Private Sub passwordChar_CheckedChanged(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) _
        Handles usePasswordChar.CheckedChanged
    If usePasswordChar.Checked = True Then
        passwordChar.ReadOnly = False
    Else
        passwordChar.ReadOnly = True
    End If
End Sub

Private Sub Button1_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click
    My.Settings.resetDataOnFail = resetOnFail.CheckState
    My.Settings.readOnlyDataOnConnected = readOnlyData.CheckState
    My.Settings.resetOnDisconnected = resetOnDisconnect.CheckState
    My.Settings.usePasswordChar = usePasswordChar.CheckState
    My.Settings.passwordChar = passwordChar.Text
    My.Settings.Save()
    Me.DialogResult = DialogResult.OK
    Me.Close()
End Sub

Private Sub Button2_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Button2.Click
    Me.DialogResult = DialogResult.Cancel
    Me.Close()
End Sub
```

Here, we handle what happens when we change whether we want to use a password character. We change the application settings when we close it and do not change them when we cancel.

That is it! I hope you enjoyed making this application and find it useful! Downloads will be available soon!
